echo Created directories:
echo   - batch\cyber\      (batch learning data)
echo   - online\cyber\     (online learning data)
echo   - cl_case1\cyber\   (continual learning case 1 data)
echo   - cl_case2\cyber\   (continual learning case 2 data)
echo.
echo âœ… Setup complete! Each experiment has its own data directory:
echo    - No conflicts between experiments
echo    - Automatic data download on first run
echo    - Independent caching for faster subsequent runs
echo.
echo You can now run any experiment - they'll handle data automatically!
